# ConvertToQR

This is a project I'm making to easily convert stuff to QR codes while aiming to be user-friendly, customizable, and quick.
I used AI for the basis of a lot of code, and uses qrcode.js as a QR Code creation library. Some code is modified from
qr-coder aswell (the idea/background.js code for multiple generation options for different contexts). This is mainly made
for 3ds users and a Chromium port is coming whenever I feel like it. Just run publish.bat in the root directory and it
will generate an xpi file using 7-Zip.
